# BridgeLabz - Projects Repository üöÄüè°

This repository serves as a collection of larger, independent projects developed as part of the BridgeLabz program. These projects demonstrate a more comprehensive application of programming concepts and system design principles, often integrating multiple functionalities into a cohesive application.

## Projects Included üìÅ

This repository contains the following project folders:

### 1. Smart Home Automation System üè†üí°

This project likely focuses on simulating or implementing aspects of a smart home environment. It could include functionalities such as:

* Controlling smart devices (lights, fans, thermostats).
* Managing user preferences and schedules.
* Integrating sensors for environmental monitoring.

### 2. Food Order üçîüõí

This project likely simulates a food ordering system, similar to what you might find in a restaurant or delivery application. It could involve:

* Managing menus and food items.
* Handling customer orders and payment processing.
* Tracking order status.
* User authentication and order history.

## Technologies Used

* **Language:** Primarily Java (given the context of previous BridgeLabz assignments, though other technologies might be integrated for specific features).
* **IDE (Recommended):** IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code with Java extensions, or Eclipse.

## How to Run These Projects üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

To get started with any of these Java-based projects, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal or Git Bash and clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/rohith1829/bridgelabz-projects.git](https://github.com/rohith1829/bridgelabz-projects.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Specific Project Directory:**
    Each project (e.g., `Smart_Home_Automation_System`, `Foodorder`) resides in its own folder. Change your current directory into the project you wish to run:
    ```bash
    cd bridgelabz-projects/Smart_Home_Automation_System
    # OR
    cd bridgelabz-projects/Foodorder
    ```

3.  **Open in your IDE:**
    Import the entire `bridgelabz-projects` into your preferred Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse). The IDE should recognize the project structure and build paths.

4.  **Compile and Run:**
    * Navigate to the specific project's folder within your IDE.
    * Locate the main class for the project (it usually contains a `public static void main(String[] args)` method).
    * You can then compile and run this file directly from within your IDE.

    Alternatively, using the **command line** (assuming you are in the specific project's directory, e.g., `bridgelabz-projects/Smart_Home_Automation_System`):
    ```bash
    # Compile all Java files in the current directory
    javac *.java
    # Run the main application (replace 'Main' with the actual main class for that system)
    java YourMainClass
    ```
